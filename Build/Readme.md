# Building tSQLt

To build tSQLt on your local machine, clode the repository in a local folder:

`git clone https://`

Open that folder in Visual Studio Code, aka VSC (Open Source, download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).)

You also need Docker Dektop (Free for non-commercial use, Download from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).) This might work with other container platforms, too.

Once ready, type `>Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...` into the top bar in VSC and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

This starts up your development container, that includes all the software needed to build tSQLt.
